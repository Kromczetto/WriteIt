# Project Documentation

This directory contains the complete technical and user documentation for the **Article Rental & Social Platform** project.

The documentation has been divided into multiple dedicated documents in order to:
- improve readability,
- clearly separate responsibilities,
- follow software engineering best practices,
- and support academic evaluation (e.g. engineering thesis review).

Each document focuses on a specific aspect of the system, such as architecture, API design, security, or user interaction.
